## Image recognition with Tensorflow

In this Go program I use the Inception image recognition model to build a command line application that takes the URL of an image as input and outputs the predicted labels.

To run use the following command:

```docker run imgrecognition https://i.pinimg.com/736x/12/5c/e0/125ce0baff3271761ca61843eccf7985.jpg```
